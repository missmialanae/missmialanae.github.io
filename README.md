# Why I am Taking Software Engineering?
  I'm taking softwar engineering in hopes to get a better feel of what is actually like to be in the industry. Granite, it is a class but I hope that what I learn in the class can be transfered to an actual job setting. I want to improve my programming abilities. While I know multiple different languages, I feel like I am not very skilled in it. I feel like coding is very important because it can be transferred to many opportunities. I also very much enjoy coding and solving problems with code and would really would like to improve as much as I can. 



# What Software Engineering Is To Me?

  Software Engineering to me is building and creating new software for a customer that will better users. Apps and programs should have a purpose and it's the software engineers job to create and design that intended purpose in the most efficient way possible with updates. Software engineering is also about improving the software we have now and making sure that is still as efficient as possible for the user and customer and make sure it is bug free.
