What Software Engineering is to me?

  Software Engineering to me is building and creating new software for a customer that will better users. Apps and programs should have a purpose and it's the software engineers job to create and design that intended purpose in the most efficient way possible with updates. Software engineering is also about improving the software we have now and making sure that is still as efficient as possible for the user and customer and make sure it is bug free.
