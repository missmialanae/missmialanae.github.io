# Chapter One of The Pragmatic Programmer 
  One thing that I definetly agree on in the first chapter of The Pragmatic Programmer is the discussion on listening to othersand encouraging others to talk. I've never thought about the importance of asking questions, and making sure everything is clearly understood. But after thinking about it in a business, I can see why it's important to be able to communicate everything clearly and asking questions because it, improves, relationships with coworkers and provides clear instruction. Both in which make a work quite effective and productive. I also like how the author discussed how listening to others kind of lends a helping hand when it is time for others to listen to you. I feel like it relates back to the idea that the small things matter. So when you take the time to actually listen to others, when its your turn people will remember that you did that for them and they are more likely to reciprocate the same gesture. 
  
   Although the book was clearly structured and made alot of sense in some parts, I did find the topic of choosing a style to be a bit confusing. Just whether it is in relation to writing and/or speaking. I would also want to know how you change your speaking style to an audience and what speaking style do you use with what audience. I can understand the process of changing your writing style with what audience you have. 
   
   A topic that I found interesting was with the set of goals the author gave us to improve our knowledge portfolio. I'm always wanting to learn the most I can about software and programming and having tips to improve is quite helpful. The tip I found the most interesting is the part when the author talks about taking classes but more on the lines of taking courses at a trade show. I honestly never thought about going to trade show and figuring out what I could learn from there. I hope to actually go to one one day.


# Why I am Taking Software Engineering?
  I'm taking softwar engineering in hopes to get a better feel of what is actually like to be in the industry. Granite, it is a class but I hope that what I learn in the class can be transfered to an actual job setting. I want to improve my programming abilities. While I know multiple different languages, I feel like I am not very skilled in it. I feel like coding is very important because it can be transferred to many opportunities. I also very much enjoy coding and solving problems with code and would really would like to improve as much as I can. 



# What Software Engineering Is To Me?

  Software Engineering to me is building and creating new software for a customer that will better users. Apps and programs should have a purpose and it's the software engineers job to create and design that intended purpose in the most efficient way possible with updates. Software engineering is also about improving the software we have now and making sure that is still as efficient as possible for the user and customer and make sure it is bug free.
